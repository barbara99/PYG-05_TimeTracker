# PYG-05_TimeTracker
A time tracker to calculate hours spent on a task and the amount of money made tackling the task

PROJECT TITLE: TIME AND WAGE TRACKER

DOCUMENTATION

INTRODUCTION:
This program was written by three success driven female tech enthusiasts. We are trainees at the Azubi Africa Program with the zeal to study and come into the job market to blaze trails. This code is our response to an assignment given us at the Azubi Africa program, 2020. It is to test our understanding and application of the python program. 
Behind this written code are zeal for success, drive for change, dedication to work and tireless work. We exhibited exemplary team work geared towards one goal. We all contributed immensely towards the success of this assignment.
The assignment demanded of us to write a program that:
•	helps the worker(Nana) track his money earned based on the number of hours he works,
•	calculates the number hours spent on a task, 
•	the entered information from the program is stored in an excel file for future referencing,
amongst others.

IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:
•	What do you want to make?
We created a time and wage tracking program that calculates amongst others, the number of hours spent on a task and the wage earned based on those hours. 

PROGRAM DEPENDENCIES:
•	In creating this program, we used python 3.0 and Microsoft Excel. We also imported date time library and the csv library. 

USER INTERACTION:
•	The program uses the system’s date for each day that the program is used.
•	The user inputs the time started and time ended for each task, the task name and a brief description of the task.
TIMELINE:
•	We had approximately two days to work on and complete this program.
DESIGN:
The program has three separate functions;
1.	Gethours Functions
2.	GetPrice Function
3.	Save to CSV Function
RUNNING THE TESTS:
The user is prompted to enter the start time, the end time, the name of the task and the description. 
The number of hours and the wages earned are displayed to the user.
The csv file which stores the data for future reference includes the wage per hour, the start time, the end time, the name of the task and the description. 
DEPLOYMENT:
A GUI can be created for the system as the front end and the code will be the front end. Buttons can be used where before the user starts working he can click the start button and when he is done with the task he will click end button. The details of hours and wages earned are then displayed to the user.
